# MarkDAT

MarkDAT is a super small (27kb) front end Markdown to HTML converter.

### Ideas

MarkDAT is really small because I made it with the intention of hosting it on the DAT protocal.

### Credit

All the MARKDOWN to HTML conversion is done by mmb[!https://github.com/p01/mmd.js] a javascript file that is super small and fast.
