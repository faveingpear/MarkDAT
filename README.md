# MarkDAT

MarkDAT is a super small (27kb) front end Markdown to HTML converter.

[MarkDAT](dat://9d9fab37a67e4986a1099abc44db05d2b66a9e31fbd19ddf23867b04d24b7249/) Must use the beaker browser to view

### Ideas

MarkDAT is really small because I made it with the intention of hosting it on the DAT protocal.

### Credit

All the MARKDOWN to HTML conversion is done by [mmb](https://github.com/p01/mmd.js) a javascript file that is super small and fast.
